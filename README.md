# HIIT Timer Plus

URL: https://timer.miscdev.com/

## Introduction

After looking around on the app stores for something simple to do this, and
finding lots of spammy apps, I decided to build my own. It's very simple,
but it works. No analytics, no ads, and no server-side logic. It's just a
timer with a few presets, and a little bit of fun.

If you save a preset, it will be saved to your browser's local storage, so
only you can access it at any time. If you change your browser, they won't
be there for you.

Maybe I'll add some more features in the future, but for now, it's just a
simple timer with presets.

Nothing to install. Just open the app in your browser.

## Disclaimer

I wrote very little code for this app. Most of it is AI Generated.ðŸ‘Œ
Use at your own risk. However, I'm using it just fine.

All of the code is in two files: `app.js` and `index.html`.
